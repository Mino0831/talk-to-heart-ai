# Talk to Heart AI

## 💡 Project Overview
**Talk to Heart AI** is a voice-based communication training system designed to help people speak with sincerity, empathy, and clarity. Instead of teaching manipulative scripts, this platform uses AI to simulate real-life conversations—enabling users to practice speaking in a way that truly connects with others.

## 🎯 Purpose
Many people struggle with communication—not because they lack vocabulary, but because they fear being misunderstood, rejected, or sounding too aggressive or too soft. This project aims to:
- Help people speak from the heart without losing structure.
- Let learners practice emotionally intelligent responses in safe, simulated spaces.
- Train users to recognize tone, timing, and empathy cues.

## 🔁 Use Flow
1. The user selects a conversation theme (e.g., Apologizing, Saying No, Handling Conflict).
2. The system simulates a human-like conversation using GPT-4o voice.
3. The user speaks out loud into the app to practice responses.
4. AI provides gentle feedback, tone suggestions, and alternate phrasing options.

## 🛠️ What I Want Devin to Help With
I'd like to evolve this concept into a production-ready platform with the following features:
- 🎙️ **Front-end voice UI** that supports speech-to-text and playback.
- 🧠 **Integration with GPT-4o API** for generating real-time, role-based dialogue.
- 📊 **Tone analysis module** that evaluates warmth, clarity, and assertiveness.
- 🗂️ **User dashboard** to track speaking progress, saved responses, and emotional tone scores.
- 🔐 **Optional privacy mode**: user data is stored locally or encrypted in cloud.

## ✅ What I Have So Far
- Full logic and learning architecture designed.
- AI prompt modules completed for 5 major scenarios: apology, disagreement, support, encouragement, boundary-setting.
- Bubble prototype partially implemented (non-voice).
- GitHub repository created for project code and deployment planning.

## 🔭 Vision
This system can eventually serve:
- Communication coaches
- Corporate training teams
- Life coaches and therapists
- Anyone who wants to say the right thing, the right way, without losing themselves

## 🤝 Contact
